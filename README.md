# Button

The button was built with Vite + React.js. To run the project, execute "npm install" followed by "npm run dev".

I used conic-gradient background rotation to achieve border animation. 
Since Framer Motion was preferred, I tried to incorporate it in the text animation.

If I had more time, I would have improved the text fading and worked on small details such as text spacing. The border animation is not identical to the original button component, so I would attempt to come up with a more accurate solution as well. 
The conic-gradient background was redering as expected on Chrome, Opera, and Brave; however, I noticed a slight rendering discrepancy on Safari. Given more time, I would have explored potential solutions for this issue.
